    "1. Segment-Specific Membership Options\n",

    "Weekend Pass: Create a \"Weekend Warrior\" membership with discounted rates for weekend-focused casual riders\n",

    "Time-Based Messaging: Schedule marketing messages to appear during peak casual hours (12-4pm)\n",
    "Duration-Based Incentives: Highlight cost savings for longer rides to appeal to casual riders' usage patterns\n",

    "3. Geographic Initiatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighborhood Focus: Prioritize conversion efforts in areas where the heatmaps show overlap between casual and member usage\n",
    "Tourist-to-Regular: Create a \"Tourist-to-Local\" program that offers visitors a discounted annual membership at the end of their trip\n",

Both groups have access to and choose the same equipment types, yet use them very differently, reinforcing our understanding that the core difference is in use case (transportation vs. leisure) rather than equipment preference."
